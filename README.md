# Pick Your Passion

**P**ick **Y**our **P**assion is a project started in 2019 with a group of folks that work at Higher Education Institutions. These folks meet quarterly to discuss analysis projects they have done that relate to the quarter's chosen topic. The goal of this community is to provide support for each other's passions while giving others inspiration to develop their analytical and data visualization skills. A submission tracker can be found [HERE](https://public.tableau.com/profile/geopkoch#!/vizhome/PickYourPassionContributions/PickYourPassionTracker).

While the group is mainly focused on delivering our projects in Tableau, I consider the group to be tool-agnostic. All types of analyses are welcome!

If you're interested in joining, email me at [geopkoch@gmail.com](mailto:geopkoch@gmail.com). If you've already participated, make sure to submit your entry [HERE](https://forms.gle/6CqjyZMN3VMdoQwG6).
